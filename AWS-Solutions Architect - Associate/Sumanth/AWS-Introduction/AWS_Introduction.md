# AWS (Amazon Web Services)
* AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It is a Great evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. 
* AWS offers a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, networking, developer tools, security, and more. 
* These services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing businesses and developers to scale and grow their applications without the need to invest in physical hardware or infrastructure.

## Lets, Analyse with Practicle Scenario:
<img width="873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77fe5875-386b-4446-a179-6856b544fee8">

* Lets Say, We Have to Run An Web Application for any organization, what are all Required set up we have to done ?
Computer, Operating System, Software, DataBase, Internet Connection, 
Server to host our application. 

### The Actual problem Arises Here,
* When your Web application Become Popular as it will grow, The Users of your Web application Become More.
* So as Our Users/Clients become More in Thousands or Millions in Number.
* We have to obviously Expand Our On-Premisis Infrastructures like, Computers, Operating Systems, Softwares, DataBases and Servers Everything to handle this Enormous traffic.
* In this Scenario, Can anybody think that can We able to Handle those Enormous traffic Situation ?
* Eventhough Answer is ```YES```, Next Question is that for Improving, Expanding, Scaling and securing all this infrastructure like Computers, Servers, Storage, Internet, Softwares. How Much Cost it may Required to an Organization to Upgrade all these Infrastructure Services as the Web Application traffic is goes on Increasing ?
* 200% Its too EXPENSIVE, If We Think from Administrative/ Business Point of View.
  
* I think, No Organizations are ready to Invest this Much of Huge Amount for Scaling thier Infrastructures. If they are Went on Thinking about all these Infrastructure, It may Imapact on their Business Logics/Technical works what exactly an Organization Wants to Perform.

### Solution :
  
* So, What you think ?
If you don't want to keep all of that with you and Some ```Service``` will do that job for you.

* That Service name is ```"AMAZON WEB SERVICES"``` (AWS).

* By setting up these components effectively on AWS,
* you can ensure that the web application for the organization is secure, scalable, highly available, and cost-efficient.
* Each setup can be customized based on specific application requirements and organizational needs. MoreOver Will only ```Pay for what we Use``` in AWS.

### ```That's why we Required Cloud Computation```



## What is Cloud Computation ?
* Cloud Computaion is the Process of Computing on-Demand availability of Computer system Resources.
* It refers to the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software and so on, over the Internet (the cloud).
* Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers or infrastructure, users can access these resources on-demand from a cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

* "Cloud" refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet that store, manage, and process data and applications, rather than a local server or personal computer.
