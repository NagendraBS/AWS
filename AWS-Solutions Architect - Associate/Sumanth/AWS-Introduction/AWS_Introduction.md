# AWS (Amazon Web Services)
* AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It is a Great evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. 
* AWS offers a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, networking, developer tools, security, and more. 
* These services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing businesses and developers to scale and grow their applications without the need to invest in physical hardware or infrastructure.

## Lets, Analyse with Practicle Scenario:
<img width="873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77fe5875-386b-4446-a179-6856b544fee8">

* Lets Say, We Have to Run An Web Application for any organization, what are all Required set up we have to done ?
Computer, Operating System, Software, DataBase, Internet Connection, 
Server to host our application. 

### The Actual problem Arises Here,
* When your Web application Become Popular as it will grow, The Users of your Web application Become More.
* So as Our Users/Clients become More in Thousands or Millions in Number.
* We have to obviously Expand Our On-Premisis Infrastructures like, Computers, Operating Systems, Softwares, DataBases and Servers Everything to handle this Enormous traffic.
* In this Scenario, Can anybody think that can We able to Handle those Enormous traffic Situation ?
* Eventhough Answer is ```YES```, Next Question is that for Improving, Expanding, Scaling and securing all this infrastructure like Computers, Servers, Storage, Internet, Softwares. How Much Cost it may Required to an Organization to Upgrade all these Infrastructure Services as the Web Application traffic is goes on Increasing ?
* 200% Its too EXPENSIVE, If We Think from Administrative/ Business Point of View.
  
* I think, No Organizations are ready to Invest this Much of Huge Amount for Scaling thier Infrastructures. If they are Went on Thinking about all these Infrastructure, It may Imapact on their Business Logics/Technical works what exactly an Organization Wants to Perform.

### Solution :
  
* So, What you think ?
If you don't want to keep all of that with you and Some ```Service``` will do that job for you.

* That Service name is ```"AMAZON WEB SERVICES"``` (AWS).

* By setting up these components effectively on AWS,
* you can ensure that the web application for the organization is secure, scalable, highly available, and cost-efficient.
* Each setup can be customized based on specific application requirements and organizational needs. MoreOver Will only ```Pay for what we Use``` in AWS.

### ```That's why we Required Cloud Computation```

-------

## What is Cloud Computation ?
* Cloud Computaion is the Process of Computing on-Demand availability of Computer system Resources.
* It refers to the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software and so on, over the Internet (the cloud).
* Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers or infrastructure, users can access these resources on-demand from a cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

* "Cloud" refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet that store, manage, and process data and applications, rather than a local server or personal computer.


## Types of Cloud Computing Services :

* There are three types of Cloud Computing Services :
  
### 1.IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): 

![AWS-Types-of-Cloud-Computing_Infrastructure-as-a-Service-N c5652344dcebff751adc45c0f75c17fb3cdd89a6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53ebb4eb-3029-417f-829f-f6f86ef3e181)


* IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT, which gives you virtualized computing resources over the internet.
* It's like renting virtual computers and storage space over the internet instead of buying and managing your own physical hardware.
* IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.
* It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar.
* Example in AWS: AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) allows you to rent virtual servers (instances) where you can run your own applications and software.

  
### 2.PaaS (Platform as a Service):

![AWS-Types-of-Cloud-Computing_Platform-as-a-Service-N 7563f3df64c8491a4dd77bd9c1f011e6c03e7ae4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84abd8f5-2fea-4bd0-ba04-e87420c41cc7)

* PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
* This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching involved in running your application.
* In Simple Words, PaaS provides a platform that helps you develop, run, and manage your applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
* It's like renting a ready-made development environment that handles things like servers, storage, and networking for you.
Examples in AWS include AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying and scaling web applications and AWS Lambda for serverless computing.

### 3.SaaS (Software as a Service):

![AWS-Types-of-Cloud-Computing_Software-as-a-Service-N 0eb7e31fda0693dd4d7219c6d4442d3360cb60b9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/182e3e19-bcfa-497c-901f-e8eddbd76926)
* SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software
* Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access these applications via a web browser.
Examples in AWS include Amazon WorkMail for email and calendar services and Amazon Chime for online meetings.

* Definition: SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, so you can access them through a web browser without needing to install or maintain any software on your own computer. It's like using a service or application directly online without worrying about the backend infrastructure.
Example in AWS: AWS Marketplace offers a variety of third-party SaaS applications that run on AWS infrastructure, such as CRM systems, collaboration tools, and productivity software.

* Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access these applications via a web browser.
Examples in AWS include Amazon WorkMail for email and calendar services and Amazon Chime for online meetings.






* Each type of cloud computing Services mentioned Above will provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs.
