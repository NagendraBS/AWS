# IAM SERVICES
# What is IAM
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
* With IAM, you can manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.
* You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

# Root user
* When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.
* This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.
